					<h1>Theresa Jacobs, the Principal</h1>
					<img class="principle-pic" src="img/principal.jpg" alt="a picture of the principal"/>
					<p>Working at Red Cross Children’s Hospital for twenty seven years in the Occupational Therapy as an assistant inspired me to improve quality of life in children.</p> 
					<p>It was not just merely a job but a passion that grew stronger, making a difference in young lives by treating children with normal developmental delays and psycho-social development.</p>
					<p>The ongoing passion for children inspired me to invest in reaching out to children to experience and gain from my knowledge and skill I have obtained over the years.</p>
					<!--<p>I wanted to invest in the community that I pursue my vision to study further by completing a NQF Level 4 and 5. I feel that it is my responsibility to reach out to children and raise up a generation.</p>-->

					<p>Full supervision at all times is one of our top priorities. A safe and peaceful environment will be enjoyed on large grounds. There are trees and equipment to stimulate and promote gross and fine-motor development.</p>
					<p>Outdoor play times will preferably differ at times for certain age groups. Younger children will benefit and thrive more freely at their own pace.</p> 
					<p>Whereby older age groups are more energetic and their co-ordination during gross motor activities is controlled faster and balanced.</p>
